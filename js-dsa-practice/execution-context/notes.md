# JavaScript Execution Context

## Two Phases
1. Memory Creation Phase
   - Variables allocated memory
   - Functions stored fully
   - var initialized as undefined

2. Execution Phase
   - Code executed line by line
   - Values assigned to variables

## Key Points
- JavaScript is single-threaded
- Execution context is created before code runs
- Hoisting happens due to memory phase
